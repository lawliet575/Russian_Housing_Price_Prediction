# Russian_Housing_Price_Prediction
The dataset used in this competition is inspired by the original Russian Housing Price Prediction dataset hosted on Kaggle. However, through SMOTE and Stresser, the actual data has been changed significantly. The revised(synthesized) dataset has around 260K rows whereas the original dataset had 30K rows.
